# Plugin-Nyquist-New-Clip-Fix-for-Audacity
This is a nyquist plugin inspired to the Clip Fix of Audacity
# Difference
Respect to Clip Fix of Audacity this is more aimed at eliminating all sorts of clipping present in the audio, in fact the threshold parameter is default to 100%. In pactice this effect has a little more repair quality than that of Audacity.
